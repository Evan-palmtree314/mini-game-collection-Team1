## Game Mechanic:
Our game is an asymmetric bullet hell game. Where one player controls a small space ship and the other player controls a big space ship acting as the boss. The game controls similarly to other top down space ship games like space invaders.

## Game Elements
Player 1:
	Movement in any direction
	Ability to slow down movement
	Shoot bullets

Player 2 (Boss):
	Movement left and right
	Shoot bullets and laser

## Technical Specs
Our game uses 2D graphics (provided in the project). Is top down and has asymmetric controls.


## Objective Statement
Is it satisfying to dodge the incoming bullets and to take down the boss ship?

## Intended Experience
The intended experience is for the players to have to dodge incoming attacks while trying to defeat their opponent in the allotted amount of time. 

## Design Rationale
The mechanic of our game could be envisioned as the base of a bigger game where each player has the ability to upgrade and change the layout, abilities and attacks of their ships. This creating a different "boss fight" every time.
